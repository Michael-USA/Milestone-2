CSC-311-Project-Milestone-2

Alice and Bob are experimenting with CDMA using a W4 Walsh table (see Figure 6.34). Show how they can detect what the other person has sent. 

Assumption: Number of stations - 4 stations 
Data bit: You can assume the data bit for each station ( presence of bit - +1, absence of bit - -1, silence - 0) 

You use any coding language for simulating this experiment
